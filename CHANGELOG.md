# Changelog

## v2.1.0 — 2026-03-24

### Stronger Hash Algorithm
- Upgraded from **xxh64** (64-bit) to **xxh128** (128-bit) for dedup hashing
- Collision probability reduced from ~1 in 2^32 to ~1 in 2^64 (birthday bound)
- Fallback changed from MD5 to **SHA-256** when xxhash is not installed
- No measurable performance impact — xxh128 is equally fast

### Cross-Run Dedup Database
- Persistent **SQLite hash cache** stored at the drive root (`.fast_copy_dedup.db`)
- Shared across all destination folders on the same drive
- Two-table design:
  - `source_cache` — caches source file hashes by (path, size, mtime) so repeat runs skip re-hashing
  - `dest_files` — tracks what content exists on the drive for cross-run dedup
- **Cross-run deduplication**: when copying to a new folder, detects files that already exist elsewhere on the drive and creates hard links instead of copying
- Reports which folders matched and how many files were deduplicated
- `--no-cache` flag to disable the database entirely
- WAL mode + synchronous OFF for minimal I/O overhead

### Verification Improvement
- Replaced per-file `stat()` calls with a single `os.walk()` pass
- Dramatically faster verification on USB drives (eliminated thousands of random I/O ops)

### Symlink Fallback Fix
- Symlinks created on NTFS (via Linux) are now verified to actually resolve
- Broken symlinks are removed and replaced with a real copy (fallback)

### GUI Support
- Browser GUI updated to use the dedup database
- Copied file hashes stored in dest_files after GUI copies complete
